Background: faint shoji texture and distant Kyoto night lights. Right-upper corner: clean dark navy gradient kept empty as logo placeholder.",

  "final_prompt": "Cinematic, ultra-detailed documentary scene in a small Kyoto apartment at night. A founder sits at a low desk, laptop open with a block-based editor being rewritten; luminous block primitives rise and stack from the screen, symbolizing rebuilding the product. Warm desk lamp from the left, cool blue monitor glow on face and hands, slight rim light. Minimalist background with faint shoji texture and distant city lights, slight film grain. Clear negative space in the right-upper 18% with a dark navy gradient reserved for the official service logo (do NOT draw a logo). High realism, strong readability, 16:9."
